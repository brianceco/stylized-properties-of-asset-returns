The Jupyter notebook, ['stylized properties of returns'](stylized_properties_of_returns.ipynb) is an accompaniment to the blog post [Stylized Properties of Asset Returns Revisited](https://summernightsintohoku.wordpress.com/2024/08/23/stylized-properties-of-asset-returns-revisited/), the latter of which discusses and reproduces the "stylized facts" of asset returns outlined in Rama Cont's 2001 [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713665670).
